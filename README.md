# GibnaMish Chess Engine

## Information
Welcome to GibnaMish, a chess engine project developed using C++. This is my first project in C++, and I have put a lot of time and effort into it. My goal is to make GibnaMish one of the best and most powerful chess engines in the world.

## Engines
The following engines have taught me a lot about chess programming, and I would like to thank their authors for their work:

- [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish)
- [Smallbrain](https://github.com/Disservin/Smallbrain)

## Tools
The following parts of the code are from other projects. I would like to thank their authors for their work, and their respective licenses remain the same:
